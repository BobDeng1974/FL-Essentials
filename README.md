## FL-Essentials
FL-Essentials is a FLTK and OpenCV based software system which provides extreme easiness in image processing with FLTK GUI. It consists of C++ class library and gives parallel processing support. It makes FLTK functionality easier, faster, and lighter. It works fine as a static or shared library.

## Repository structure

FLE Library is implemented in C++ (but provides both a C and a 
C++ish interface). The directory structure is: <br/>

-  /applications (application developed in FLE) <br/>			
-  /code	 (Source code) <br/>						
-  /include (Public header C and C++ header files) <br/>		
-  /lib (Static libraries for VS2013, VS2015) <br/>		
-  /samples (Examples to illustrate possible use cases for FLE) <br/>

## Building
Take a look into the `INSTALL` file. The build system is CMake, if you already used CMake before there is a good chance you know what to do.
